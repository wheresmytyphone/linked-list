## Synopsis

This project is a a bookmark application that keeps track of important web pages one is interested in.  The application was developed in order to practice using jQuery for logic and DOM manipulation.  This project was developed for a class at the Turing School of Software and Design.

## Usage
One needs to enter the name of the webpage along with its corresponding URL.  Upon clicking the Enter button, a new card is generated that contains the information for the new page.  One can then click on the link on the card, and it will open a new tab for the page.  One can mark the links they have looked at before by clicking Read at the bottom left corner.  The top of the page gives the user feedback as to how many links have been created and how many have been marked read.  If the user would like to delete the link, they can press Delete at the bottom right corner.  If the user would like to get rid of all links that are marked as read, the user may select the Clear Read button.
